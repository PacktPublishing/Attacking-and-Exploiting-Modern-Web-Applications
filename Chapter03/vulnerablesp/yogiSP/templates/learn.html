<p>This application is designed to help show some of the pitfalls that can come when configuring applicaitons to use SAML.</p>
<p>Please note that while the application is designed to show serveral of the things that can be done wrong to make an application vulnerable. There is nothing inheriently wrong with utilizing it if implemented properly.</p>

                <li>This is the server that handles the authentication. In the current environment the IDP is the 'Jellystone IDP.' This is who you prove you are who you say you are to. An IDP may have back end connections to AD, or it could check against another database of users. IDPs can also help to easily implment mutli-factor authentication. Removing the burden from the application developer.</li>

<h2>Authentication Flows</h2>
<center><img src="/static/images/environment.png" style="width:60%;height:60%;"></center>

<p>The most important thing is to make sure that a service provider (web app, etc.) is checking to make sure that the messages from the Identity Provider(IDP) are signed, and valid.</p>
<p>If the messages are not signed, or are signed but not valid the application should reject them.
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the signature and edit attributes</li>
        <li>Leave the signature and edit attributes</li>
        <li>Edit the attributes and resign it with my own signature</li>
    </ul>
    Each of those actions should result in a login failure being generated.
